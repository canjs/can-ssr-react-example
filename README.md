[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/canjs/can-ssr-react-example.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An example React app using can-ssr's asynchronous rendering capabilities.

## Testing

After cloning this repo run:

```
npm install
```

Then look at `index.js` and run `node render`. Running the render script opens up the application and makes a request.
